"Tracking Customer Journey in E-commerce with SQL Recursive CTEs"

 Introduction
 Hello, everyone! In today’s video, we’ll explore how to 
 map customer journeys in SQL. This is a crucial technique for e-commerce
 businesses that want to understand each step customers take, from browsing
 to checkout. We’ll use recursive CTEs to visualize customer journeys and
 identify key points where customers drop off.

 Purpose:
 The purpose of this video is to show you how to track customer interactions 
 on an e-commerce site using SQL. This technique helps businesses better 
 understand heir customers' behavior, which can lead to more targeted marketing 
 and improved conversions.

 Problem Statement:
 E-commerce platforms track a range of customer actions, but mapping
 the complete journey across sessions is complex. We need a method to
 capture and order actions chronologically while preserving each session's
 flow.

 Solution Overview:
 We’ll create a recursive CTE in SQL to manage this journey data. 
 Our CTE will help us to identify the path of customer actions within each
 session and show where customers drop off. Let’s dive into the code.
